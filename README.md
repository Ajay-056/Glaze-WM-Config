# Glaze-WM-Config (‚≠êStar the Repository if you like or clone it üòÉ)

Pro / Nerd Level configuration for which I have spent a lot of time. Hope its awesome to use !!

**Pro-tips:** 
- Run Glaze WM as administrator to make sure all the features are enabled without any issues.
- Use Task shell:startup / Task Scheduler to run the executable automatically at the login.
- Use a Nerd Font to ensure all the icons and glyphs render properly. Download your favourite font from here <https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads>. My Favourite one is Cascaydia Code.
- Hide Your Task bar to freeup some unwanted space since taskbar is replaced by glaze WM bar.
- Use GlazeWM alongside Powertoys Run (To mimic like dmenu or rofi) <https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys>
